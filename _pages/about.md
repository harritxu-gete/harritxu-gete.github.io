<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I work in the **Speech and Natural Language Technologies** department at Vicomtech, specializing in **Natural Language Generation** and **Machine Translation**, while pursuing my PhD. My research bridges computational linguistics and sustainability. I focus on optimizing language model training to enhance performance for low-resource languages while reducing energy consumption, contributing to the broader **Green AI** initiative. My work aims to make NLP technologies **accessible, equitable, and environmentally sustainable**.
